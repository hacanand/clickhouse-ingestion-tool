# ClickHouse Backend Setup
This repository contains a backend setup for ClickHouse, a fast open-source OLAP database management system. The setup includes Docker configurations for easy deployment and management of ClickHouse instances.
## Prerequisites
- Docker: Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. You can download it from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- Docker Compose: This is included with Docker Desktop, but if you're using Linux, you may need to install it separately. You can find instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
- Basic knowledge of Docker and Docker Compose.
## Directory Structure

```

```
- `docker-compose.yml`: This file defines the services, networks, and volumes for the ClickHouse setup.
- `Dockerfile`: This file contains the instructions to build the  ClickHouse instance.
## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```
2. **Build the Docker Image**: Navigate to the directory containing the `Dockerfile` and run the following command to build the Docker image:
   ```bash
    docker build -t clickhouse-backend .
    ```
3. **Start the ClickHouse Instance**: Use Docker Compose to start the ClickHouse instance. Run the following command in the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
4. **Access ClickHouse**: Once the container is running, you can access ClickHouse using the following command:
    ```bash
    docker exec -it <container-name> clickhouse-client
    ```
   Replace `<container-name>` with the name of your ClickHouse container. You can find the container name by running `docker ps`.
    

5. **Initialize the Database**: If you have any initialization scripts (like `init.sql` or `init.sh`), you can run them inside the ClickHouse container. For example:
    ```bash
    docker exec -i <container-name> clickhouse-client < init/init.sql
    ```
   or
    ```bash
    docker exec -i <container-name> bash init/init.sh
    ```
6. **Stop the ClickHouse Instance**: To stop the ClickHouse instance, run the following command:
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```
7. **Remove the Docker Image**: If you want to remove the Docker image, run the following command:
    ```bash
    docker rmi clickhouse-backend
    ```
## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the ports defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file are not already in use on your host machine.
- You can customize the `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile` files to suit your specific requirements.
- For more information on ClickHouse, refer to the [official documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/).
- For more information on Docker and Docker Compose, refer to the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
- If you encounter any issues, check the logs of the ClickHouse container using:
    ```bash
    docker logs <container-name>
    ```
- If you need to run any ClickHouse commands, you can do so using the `clickhouse-client` command inside the container.
- If you want to run the ClickHouse server in the foreground, you can use the following command:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

- If you want to run the ClickHouse server in the background, you can use the following command:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

- If you want to remove the ClickHouse container and its associated volumes, you can use the following command:
    ```bash
    docker-compose down -v
    ```
